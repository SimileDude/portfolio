      <h1>I develop for the web</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Ash, but friends call me Ashman. Iâ€™m a full stack developer
        and my language of choice is Javascript, with Reactjs on the front-end
        and Nodejs on the backend. And while solving challenging engineering
        problems is what I do day-in and day-out, UI/UX is very close to my
        heart and I try to make the web a little better to use and look at, one
        element at a time.
