      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>Hi! My name is Ash, and thanks for taking the time to be here.</p>
      <p>
        I'm passionate about building web applications and features using
        robust, tried-and-tested technologies. Behind the scenes, I diligently
        strive to craft clean code that is easily extendible in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        My ultimate goal is to contribute to a high-performing team, delivering
        exceptional products that make a meaningful difference in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        I bring valuable experience in leading small, agile teams that
        prioritize value and efficiency. My strong belief in lean methodologies
        has been reinforced through my time spent in the manufacturing industry,
        where I gained firsthand knowledge of the lean principles pioneered by
        Toyota.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm open to engage with recruiters, hiring managers, and fellow software
        engineers to discuss potential projects and opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>Feel free to reach out, and let's start a conversation!</p>
